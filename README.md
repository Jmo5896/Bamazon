# Bamazon
        The original purpose of this project was to teach myself mySQL,
    and to make a working back-end application that will be able to track 
    inventory and organize products.  I created three different views
    for the data: customer, manager, and supervisor.  

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

    *Prerequisites:
        You will need both MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/) and an app for your mySQL databases,
        I use HeidiSQL (https://www.heidisql.com/download.php)

    *Getting Bamazon Running:
        1. Clone this repository to your local machine, for help check out https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-cli/clone-repo-cli
        2. When it finishes downloading run "npm i" this will install the following npm packages that you will need for the app to run:
            *console.table
            *inquirer
            *mysql
        3. Next you will want to open your HeidiSQL, and copy paste the schema.sql file into the query line to seed/set up the databases.  
        (Don't forget to hit run!!!)
        4. Now you are all set up to run any of the 3 options
